      You can create a Web page on your desktop computer but nobody can see it
      but you. If your want other people to be able to see your Web pages, you
      need an account a computer that has a Web server. Nowadays most people
      have their own computers on their desks, but normally they don't have Web
      servers and anyway you don't want the whole world coming into your desktop
      computer to see your web page because (a) it's not designed for that, and
      (b) who knows what else they might see. And (c) for security reasons, Web
      servers should be managed by professionals. Most institutions have big
      central shared computers for this purpose, which usually have a
      <a href="http://kermitproject.org/unix.html">Unix</a>-like operating
      system such as Linux. You need an account on one of these so you can put
      your web pages there. If you don't have access to such a computer, you can
      get a low-cost account on a service like
      <a href="http://panix.com">Panix.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can still create Web pages on your own computer and look at them with
      your computer's Web browser, but for other people to see them, you have to
      upload them to the "big" computer that has the Web browser. The rest of
      this document is about how to create your first Web page.
    </p>

    <h3 id="basics">1. Creating a Web Page</h3>

    This page was typed by hand. Anybody can do this, you don't need any special
    "web creation" tools or HTML editors, and the pages you make can be viewed
    from any browser. To see how this page was made, choose
    <b>View Source</b> (or View Page Source, or View Document Source) in your
    browser's menu (or — in at least Chrome and Firefox — Ctrl-U on your
    keyboard). A simple web page like this one is just plain text with HTML
    commands (markup) mixed in. HTML commands (properly called "tags")
    themselves are plain text.

    <p>
      When you're just learning and want to experiment, you can do everything on
      your PC. Create a new directory ("folder") for your website, and then put
      the web-page files (HTML plus any pictures) in it. Use NotePad or other
      plain-text editor (not word processor) on your PC to create your "home
      page", a file named
      <span class="tt">index.html</span>, which you can view locally with your
      Web browser. (You can also use word processors such as Word or WordPad if
      you save in "plain text", "text", "text document", or "text document
      MS-DOS format".) <a href="#install">Later</a> I'll explain how you can
      install your web site on the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've made your "home page" (index.html) you can add more pages to
      your site, and your home page can link to them.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <dl>
      <dt><i>Example for Windows:</i></dt>
      <dd>
        Move your mouse cursor to the desktop. Right-click, choose <i>New</i>,
        then choose <i>Folder</i>, and a "New Folder" appears, with its name
        highlighted. Type "Web" to change the folder's name to Web (or anything
        else you want). Then start NotePad to create your first Web page.
      </dd>

    <h3 id="syntax">2. HTML Syntax</h3>

    Web pages are written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). HTML has three
    special characters:
    <span class="tt">&lt;</span>, <span class="tt">&amp;</span>,
    <span class="tt">&gt;</span>. An HTML command is enclosed in
    <span class="tt">&lt;...&gt;</span>, for example
    <span class="tt">&lt;p&gt;</span>, which is a paragraph separator, or
    <span class="tt">&lt;b&gt;</span> ("begin bold") and
    <span class="tt">&lt;/b&gt;</span> ("end bold"). So the following HTML text:

    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
This sentence contains &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text.
  </pre
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      produces:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>This sentence contains <b>bold</b> text.</blockquote>
    <p>
      A Web page starts with a series of HTML commands, and ends with a few
      more. The contents go in between:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
  &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;META charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &lt;META name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Sample Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  </pre
      >
      <p>
        <i>(Contents go here)</i>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <pre>
&lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
  </pre
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The first line (<span class="tt">DOCTYPE</span>) specifies which language
      the page uses (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> =
      Hypertext Markup Language); just copy this line. The next line,
      <span class="tt">&lt;html&gt;</span>, starts the page, and is matched by
      the last line, <span class="tt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>, which closes the
      page. <span class="tt">&lt;head&gt;</span>, starts the heading, which
      contains a title to be displayed on the browser's title bar and a
      declaration of the character set (nowadays it should always be
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>) and the
      "viewport" line which is a compulsory adaptation for cell phones, "smart"
      watches, etc. <span class="tt">&lt;/head&gt;</span> closes the heading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="tt">&lt;body&gt;</span> tag starts the body of the
      document, is closed by <span class="tt">&lt;/body&gt;</span> tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see, most HTML commands come in begin-end pairs:
      <span class="tt">&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</span>,
      <span class="tt">&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</span>, etc. The closing
      part of the command has a slash (<span class="tt">/</span>) between the
      <span class="tt">&lt;</span> and the first letter of the command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blank lines and line breaks are ignored. The browser automatically "flows"
      your text into lines and paragraphs that fit in its window. Paragraphs
      must be separated by <span class="tt">&lt;p&gt;</span>. Line breaks can be
      forced by <span class="tt">&lt;br&gt;</span>.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <dl>
      <dt><i>Example for Windows:</i></dt>
      <dd>
        Use the mouse to copy the HTML above into NotePad. Then save the file
        (<i>File</i>&nbsp;<span class="tt">-&gt;</span
        >&nbsp;<i>Save&nbsp;As...</i>) in your Web directory as
        <span class="tt">index.html</span>. Suppose your Windows username is
        Olga. Then (depending on which version of Windows you have) this might
        be:

        <p></p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre><span class="tt">C:\Documents and Settings\Olga\Desktop\Web\index.html</span>
  </pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Now to see your new web page, just double-click on the Web folder and
          then double-click on <span class="tt">index.html</span>.
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      Now you're ready to start adding "content" to your web page. Go back to
      NotePad and replace the title and "(Contents go here)" with whatever you
      want. Any time you want to see the result, use
      <i>File</i>&nbsp;<span class="tt">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<i>Save</i> in NotePad
      and then click the Reload button on your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next sections tell how to achieve different kinds of effects.

    <h3 id="chars">3. Special Characters</h3>

    HTML special "character entities" start with ampersand (<span class="tt"
      >&amp;</span
    >) and end with semicolon (<span class="tt">;</span>), like "<span
      class="tt"
      >&amp;euro;</span
    >" = "€". The ever-popular "no-break space" is
    <span class="tt">&amp;nbsp;</span>. There are special entity names for
    accented Latin letters and other West European special characters such as:

    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <table border="">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="tt">&amp;auml;</span></td>
            <td>a-umlaut</td>
            <td>&nbsp;ä&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="tt">&amp;Auml;</span></td>

      recommended, you can also enter any character at all, Roman, Cyrillic,
      Arabic, Hebrew, Greek. Japanese, etc, either as numeric entities or (if
      you have a way to type them) directly from the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      And remember: if you want to include <span class="tt">&lt;</span>,
      <span class="tt">&amp;</span>, or <span class="tt">&gt;</span> literally
      in text to be displayed, you have to write
      <span class="tt">&amp;lt;</span>, <span class="tt">&amp;amp;</span>,
      <span class="tt">&amp;gt;</span>, respectively.

    <h3 id="convert">4. Converting Plain Text to HTML</h3>

    If you have a plain text file that you want to convert to HTML, load the
    file into a plain-text editor and then follow these steps.

    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Change all occurrences of "<span class="tt">&amp;</span>" to "<span
          class="tt"
          >&amp;amp;</span
        >".
      </li>
      <li>
        Change all occurrences of "<span class="tt">&lt;</span>" to "<span
          class="tt"
          >&amp;lt;</span
        >".
      </li>
      <li>
        Change all occurrences of "<span class="tt">&gt;</span>" to "<span
          class="tt"
          >&amp;gt;</span
        >".
      </li>
      <li>
        Change any accented letters to HTML entity names (previous section).
      </li>
      <li>Put "<span class="tt">&lt;p&gt;</span>" between each paragraph.</li>
      <li>
        Insert the standard prolog at the top, substituting an appropriate
        title.
      </li>
      <li>Insert the standard epilog at the bottom.</li>
      <li>
        Save the result as <span class="tt"><i>xxx</i>.html</span>, where
        <span class="tt"><i>xxx</i></span> is the part of the original file's
        name before the dot. For example, if the original file was
        <span class="tt">letter.txt</span>, save the edited version as
        <span class="tt">letter.html</span>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you are a <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">Kermit</a> user,
      you can find a script to convert plain text to HTML
      <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckscripts.html#html">HERE</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the text contains lists, tables, or other structures, read on.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a Microsoft Word document you want to convert to HTML, and
      your copy of Word does not allow the file to be "Saved As" HTML, then save
      it as plain text and follow the same instructions. In this case you lose
      the "richness" (bold, italics, font changes, etc) when you save the file,
      and will have to put the effects back by hand (next section).
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <hr />
    <h3 id="effects">5. Effects</h3>

    The rest of this document shows some of what you can do with simple HTML
    commands, but I don't explain how to do it. To see that, just tell your
    browser to <b>View Source</b> and compare the HTML in the source window with
    the result in the original window.

    <blockquote>
      <i>Note:</i> In this and the following sections, I use some "deprecated"
      features from earlier HTML versions because they are easier for beginners
      to learn (for example
      <span class="tt">&lt;big&gt;...&lt;/big&gt;</span> versus
      <span class="tt" style="white-space: pre;">
        &lt;span style="font-size:120%"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;</span
      >).
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>This sentence is bold.</b> <i>This sentence is in italics.</i>
      <b><i>This sentence is in bold italics.</i></b>
      <span class="tt">This sentence is in typewriter font.</span> This sentence
      has <u>underlined words</u> and <u><b>underlined bold words</b></u
      >.

      <font color="blue">This</font>
      <font color="red">sentence</font>
      <font color="green">has</font>
      <font color="brown">colored</font>
      <font color="magenta">words</font>. This sentence has
      <big>big words.</big> This one has <big><big>very big words</big></big
      >. This one has
      <small><small>very small words.</small></small>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      This is a "blockquote", which is like a regular paragraph, but it has
      bigger margins. Begin a blockquote with
      <span class="tt">&lt;blockquote&gt;</span> and end it with
      <span class="tt">&lt;/blockquote&gt;</span>. Environments such as
      blockquotes, lists, etc, that have a beginning and an end always use
      paired commands like
      <span class="tt">&lt;<i>blah</i>&gt;...&lt;<i>/blah</i>&gt;</span>.

      <p></p>
      <blockquote>
        This is a blockquote inside another blockquote, which shows how HTML
        environments can be "nested".
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Here we are back in the first blockquote again.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And here we are back outside of the first blockquote.

    <h3 id="lists">6. Lists</h3>

    Here is an Unordered (bullet) List (<span class="tt"
      >&lt;ul&gt;..&lt;ul&gt;</span
    >):

    <ul>
      <li>This is a List Item (<span class="tt">&lt;li&gt;</span>).</li>
      <li>This is another item.</li>
      <li>This is yet another item.</li>
    </ul>

    Here is an Ordered (numbered) List (<span class="tt"
      >&lt;ol&gt;..&lt;ol&gt;</span
    >):

    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li>This is a List Item (<span class="tt">&lt;li&gt;</span>).</li>
      <li>This is another item.</li>
      <li>This is yet another item.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And here is a Description List (<span class="tt">&lt;dl&gt;</span>). using
      Kermit commands as an example:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <dl>
      <dt><span class="tt">SET FILE TYPE BINARY</span></dt>
      <dd>
        This command tells Kermit to transfer files in binary mode. In other
        words, don't mess with the file, just send it as-is. The result on the
        receiving computer should be identical to the original.

        <p></p>
      </dd>
      <dt><span class="tt">SET FILE TYPE TEXT</span></dt>
      <dd>
        This command tells Kermit to transfer files in text mode. This should be
        used with plain-text files, especially when transferring them between
        computers with different file formats or operating systems, such as VMS
        and Unix, or Unix and Windows. It converts the file's format and
        character-set (if necessary) so the received file is usable on the
        destination computer.

    <h3 id="links">7. Links</h3>

    Links can be internal within a Web page (like to the
    <a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a> at the top), or they can be to
    external web pages or pictures on the same website, or they can be to
    websites, pages, or pictures anywhere else in the world.

    <p>
      Here is a link to the
      <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">Kermit Project home page</a>.
      And here is what the HTML looks like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/"&gt;Kermit Project home page&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre
      >
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The part inside the quotes is called the URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
      Here is a link to <a href="#lists">Section 4</a> of this document, and the
      HTML:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;a href="#lists"&gt;Section 4&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre
      >
    </blockquote>

    The "#" indicates an internal section ID, in this case:

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;h3 id="lists"&gt;6. Lists&lt;/h3&gt;
  </pre
      >
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Here is a link to
      <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckuins.html#x4.0">Section 4.0</a>
      of another document, at another website; the
      <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckuins.html"
        >C-Kermit for Unix Installation Instructions</a
      >. And the HTML:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckuins.html#x4.0"&gt;Section 4.0&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre
      >
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Here is a link to a picture:
      <a href="picture-of-something.jpg">CLICK HERE</a> to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to link to a particular section of somebody else's Web page,
      visit the page, "view source", search for the text at that spot and see if
      there is an "id=" clause; if so, use the ID as shown just above; if not
      you're out of luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to link to a particular page of a PDF document, just put
      "#page=123" (replace by the desired number) at the end of the URL.

    <h3 id="install">10. Installing Your Web Page on the Internet</h3>

    How to put your web page on the Internet depends on your Internet Service
    Provider (ISP). At Columbia University, each user has a "shell account" on
    the central server, which runs a Unix-based operating system, and which you
    can access with a terminal emulator such as
    <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">Kermit</a>. Here's an example that
    applies to Columbia University's web server, showing how to upload your
    files from Windows:

    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>
        There are easier ways to do this than what I describe below, but they
        require add-on software. The following method should work for everybody
        who has Windows and an Internet connection.
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      If you create a <span class="tt">public_html</span> subdirectory of your
      login directory, give it "world" read and search permission, and then
      create an <span class="tt">index.html</span> file in that directory and
      give it world read permission, you'll have a home page. In this example
      "<span class="tt">$</span>" is the shell prompt (yours might be
      different), and what you type is underlined. CAUTION: the directory name
      is <span class="tt">public_html</span> but the underscore might be
      obscured the underline in the examples below. Whenenever typing "<span
        class="tt"
        >public_html</span
      >" always include the underscore. CAUTION#2: Some Web hosting sites might
      use different a different name for the user's Web directory.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>$ <u>cd</u>                      <i>(Change to your login directory)</i>
  $ <u>mkdir public_html</u>       <i>(Create</i> public_html <i>subdirectory)</i>
  $ <u>chmod 755 public_html</u>   <i>(Give it world read/search permission)</i>
  $ <u>cd public_html</u>          <i>(Enter the</i> public_html <i>subdirectory)</i>
  </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You only have to do this part once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's assume you have created a website in the Web folder on your PC.
      Here's an example of how to upload your Web files to your
      <span class="tt">public_html</span>
      directory on Columbia University's Cunix server using FTP (File Transfer
      Protocol). First start the FTP program:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Start</i>&nbsp;<span class="tt">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<i>Run</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      and type "ftp" in the box. An FTP window opens and an "<span class="tt"
        >ftp&gt;</span
      >" prompt appears. Type the underlined commands at the "<span class="tt"
        >ftp&gt;</span
      >" prompt (substituting your own user ID, etc):
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
  ftp&gt; <u>lcd Desktop</u>
  Local directory now C:\Documents and Settings\olga\Desktop.
  ftp&gt; <u>lcd Web</u>
  Local directory now C:\Documents and Settings\olga\Desktop\Web.
  ftp&gt; <u>open cunix</u>
  Connected to cunix.cc.columbia.edu.
  220 Cunix FTP server (Version 5.60) ready.
  User (cunix.cc.columbia.edu:(none)): <u>olga</u>
  331 Password required for olga.
  Password: <u><i>(type your password here)</i></u>
  230 User olga logged in.
  ftp&gt; <u>cd public_html</u>   <i>(That's</i> "public_html" <i>in case you can't see the underscore)</i>
  ftp&gt; <u>binary</u>
  ftp&gt; <u>put index.html</u>
  200 PORT command successful.
  150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for index.html.
  226 Transfer complete.
  ftp: 285 bytes sent in 0.00Seconds 285000.00Kbytes/sec.
  ftp&gt; <u>site chmod 664 index.html</u>
  200 CHMOD command successful
  ftp&gt; <u>bye</u>
  </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This sends the <span class="tt">index.html</span> file to your
      <span class="tt">public_html</span> directory on the server. You can send
      any other file by substituting its name for "<span class="tt"
        >index.html</span
      >. If you want to send all the files in your Web folder, replace "<span
        class="tt"
        >put index.html</span
      >
      with "<span class="tt">put&nbsp;*</span>" (asterisk, meaning "all files"
      in this directory). Always use binary mode unless you know what you're
      doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the "site chmod" command failed (this service is not supported by some
      FTP servers), you have one more step. Before others can see your web
      files, you have to give them "world read" permission. Again, log in to the
      server using a terminal emulator (Telnet, SSH, Kermit, whatever), and:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>$ <u>cd ~/public_html</u>        <i>(Enter the</i> public_html <i>subdirectory)</i>
  $ <u>chmod 664 *</u>             <i>(Make all files publically readable)</i>
  </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Now you have a home page. If you were at Columbia and your login ID was
      "olga", the address (URL) of your home page would be:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="tt">http://www.columbia.edu/~olga/</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      If you want to add pictures to your Web page, you can upload those too
      (also with Kermit or FTP), and you also have to "chmod 664" all the files
      to make them readable by everybody. Every time you add new files to your
      <span class="tt">public_html</span> directory, you have to
      "chmod&nbsp;664" them so they are accessible, either in the FTP session
      itself (as shown previously), or by logging in to the host and:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>$ <u>cd ~/public_html</u>   <i>(That's</i> "public_html" <i>in case you can't see the underscore)</i>
  $ <u>chmod 664 *</u>
  </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Pictures should be in JPG or GIF format. To include a picture ("image") in
      your page, include a sequence like this at the desired spot:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;img src="<i>filename</i>" alt="brief description"&gt;
  </pre
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Replace <i>filename</i> by the name of the file (e.g.
      <span class="tt">skyline.jpg</span>). Almost every HTML tag can be
      customized by "attributes" in the begin tag. For example if you want the
      image to scale itself to the viewer's window (on a computer, cell phone,
      or other device), and furthermore you want the text of the page to flow
      around it, you can do:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="example">
      &lt;img alt="brief description" style="width:50%; max-width:500px;
      float:left; margin:10px;" src="<i>filename</i>"&gt;
    </blockquote>

    You can look up the attributes in Google, just search for <i>html width</i>,
    <i>html float</i>, etc.

    <p>
      Now you have your own home page on the Web, and your own URL (Uniform
      Resource Locator, or Web address). In this example, the URL is:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~olga/"
        ><span class="tt">http://www.columbia.edu/~olga/</span></a
      >
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Of course, if you prefer, you can also do all the Web-page editing
      directly on the server, using an a server-based text editor like EMACS,
      Pico, or Vi while logged in to the Unix shell. In that case you don't need
      to upload anything (except maybe photos), but then you also need to be
      more familiar with the server's Unix environment and commands and
      utilities.
    </p>

    <h3 id="more">11. Where to go from here</h3>

    Most Web pages are created by hideous bloated "Web Authoring" tools, which
    are usually designed to hook you (and readers of your web pages) into some
    corporate profit-making scheme. If all you want is text with some pictures
    and links and maybe some tables, as opposed to spinning blinking popup
    holograms with streaming video and sound effects, it's best to keep it
    simple and do it yourself. This is how the Web started off in the HTML 1.0
    days of the early 1990s. The ingenious thing was that it was self
    propogating. If you saw a web page with a certain effect and wanted to know
    how it was done, you could simply "view source" to get the "source code" and
    then adapt it to your own page. You can still do that with pages that look
    like this one, but since most Web pages are no longer made by hand, you'll
    often see tons of incomprehensible gibberish (the more special effects, the
    more gibberish), for example at <a href="https://www.cnn.com">CNN</a>.

    <p>
      Anyway, if you have mastered the simple techniques shown in this page, you
      know the basics. Which is more than can be said of many "web designers"
      who only know how to use prepackaged software to create web pages by
      picking things from menus and moving things around with a mouse. To go
      further, you can almost always find out how to do what you want by
      searching Google ("html how do I ...?"), or looking at the HTML code of
      different websites (browser "view source" command) but, again, only for
      pages that look like this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course HTML is a standard, and here are the official references:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/">HTML 5.2 specification</a>
        (2017).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS"
          >Cascading Style Sheets</a
        >
        (yet another "standard" layered on top of HTML, which, like HTML goes
        through many versions, each one making the previous on obsolete).
      </li>
    </ul>

    You can check the validity of your web page at the
    <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>. Note
    that this page itself does not pass the Validator because it uses a number
    of "obsolete" elements. That's because (a) they are much easier to explain,
    and (b) they still work. For the first 20 years or so, HTML was in flux, but
    with the release of HTML5 in 2014, it seems to be pretty stable.

    <p>
      You can find lots more Web pages in the same simple style as this one at
      the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">Kermit Project</a> website
      and the
      <a href="http://kermitproject.org/newdeal/"
        >New York City New Deal website</a
      >.
